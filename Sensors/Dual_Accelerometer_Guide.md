# Dual Accelerometer Guide

## 1. Introduction
For a general start up guide on sensors, refer to [this guide](./Sensors/GUIDE.md)

## 2. Sensor Setup
In order to utilize 2 accelerometers, the sensors need to have different addresses for the Arduino to recognize that data is coming from different sources. The address pin is found on the back of the sensor. By soldering over the address pin (left) on one of the accelerometers, this will change its address from 0x68 to 0x69.

Unfortunately, the DFRobot BMX160 Library in Arduino does not have a designated function to allow for the definition of 2 different addresses, as the address 0x68 is hard-coded in. To change this, we’ll have to modify the library itself.
1.	Navigate to the Arduino library. This will likely be in "C:\Users\Username\Documents\Arduino\libraries\DFRobot_BMX160"
2.	Open “DFRobot_BMX160.cpp” and “DFRobot_BMX160.h” in a code editor. If you don't have a code editor already installed, you can [download VSCode here!](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3.	In the .cpp file, find the begin() function and make the following changes below. Make sure to save! 

Original:
```c++
bool DFRobot_BMX160::begin()
{
    _pWire->begin();
    if (scan() == true){
        ...
    }
    else
        return false;
}
```
Modified:
```c++
bool DFRobot_BMX160::begin( uint8_t addr)
{
    _pWire->begin();
    _addr = addr; 
    if (scan() == true){
       ...
    }
    else
        return false;
}
```
4.	In the .h file, find the corresponding begin() function definition and the variable _addr. These should be at lines 988 and 1106 respectively. Make the following changes highlighted below.
Original: 
`    bool begin();`
Modified:
`    bool begin( ==uint8_t addr==);`
Original: 
`    uint8_t _addr == = 0x68==;`
Modified: 
`    uint8_t _addr;`

Now that the library has been modified, the begin function will set an address for each sensor and allow for differentiation between the data coming from the sensors. When you set up the sensors in Arduino, ensure that you specify the address of the sensor in your code as so:
```C
  if (!sensor1.begin(0x68)) { 
    Serial.println("Sensor 1 failed!");
    while (1);
  }
  if (!sensor2.begin(0x69)) {
    Serial.println("Sensor 2 failed!");
    while (1);
  }
```
When wiring your sensors into the Arduino, make sure that the accelerometers are plugged into I2C terminals. This will require the use of either a breadboard or female-to-female jumper wires as you need to ensure that the wires are all connected to the same ports (VCC to VCC, GND to GND, etc.)
