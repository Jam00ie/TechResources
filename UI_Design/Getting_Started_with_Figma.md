# Getting Started with Figma

Figma is a cloud-based collaborative design tool used by designers, developers, and students to create UI/UX, wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and even design systems. It works entirely in your browser/desktop app and is free for students and educators. You can also explore thousands of community templates, UI kits, and starter files to get started quickly.

Figma excels at:
- Designing app/web/mobile screens visually - no coding required
- Prototype interactions like clicks, transitions, and scrolling (prototypes are visual, not functional code)
- Real time collaboration - multiple people can edit the same file at once

## Quick Interface Tour
- Left sidebar: Layers, pages, assets (components/library)
- Center: Your infinite workspace
- Right sidebar: Properties (fill, stroke, text, auto layout, prototyping, variables)
- Toolbar: Move (V), Frame (F), Shape tools, Pen (P), Comment, etc.

## Core Building Blocks

### 1. Frames
- Frames are like artboards or screen containers.
- Shortcut: F

### 2. Adding Basic Elements
- Shapes: Rectangle (R), Ellipse (O), Line (L), Polygon, Star
- Text (T): Use the right panel to set font family, size, weight, line height, and letter spacing
- Images & Icons: Drag & drop files, paste from clipboard, or use community plugins like Unsplash

### 3. Layers Panel
- Every element is a layer
- Group related layers (Ctrl/Cmd + G)
- Nest layers inside frames for hierarchy

### 4. Auto Layout
- Select a frame or group of elements → click the + Auto Layout button (or Shift + A)
- Adjust direction: horizontal, vertical, or wrap
- Control spacing, padding, alignment, distribution, and resizing behavior

### 5. Components & Variants
- Select a group of elements → click the create component button
- Variants let one component have multiple states: default, hover, pressed, disabled
- Use component instances across your design and updating the main component automatically updates all of its instances

### 6. Prototyping
- Switch to the Prototype tab → drag arrows from one frame to another to connect screens
- Click Play on the top right corner to open full screen preview or share the link to test on phone/browser

Happy designing! 🎨
