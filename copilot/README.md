# Using Copilot in a workshop

GitHub Copilot is an effective way to iterate over engineering solutions that use computer code.
This guide provides actionable playbooks on how to use Copilot designed for workshops or hackathons.
Workshops and hackathons are designed for you to engineer prototypes quickly while covering a larger solution space.
This makes tools like Copilot useful to "scaffold" your design such that it can be finalized at a later date for learning.
